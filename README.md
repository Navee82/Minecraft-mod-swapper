# Minecraft-mod-swapper
A simple python project to swap your mods in your .minecraft folder by having different profiles so you don't have to change these mods manually ever again.

For peopole to know : I'm a young french trying to code something, so please forgive my english and my bad project managment.
This is my first python project, the code is probably horrible but hey, it works ! (i'm constantly improving the code)


## HOW TO USE THE MOD SWAPPER ?

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Navee82/Minecraft-mod-swapper/blob/main/wiki.md) as well for more detailed informations !

Your first need to have python 3.12, Tkinter, PyYaml and Requests installed.

If you don't know how to install the libraries simply executes the following commands in a terminal :

``pip install tk`` <br>
``pip install PyYAML`` <br>
``pip install requests`` <br>

It is actually very simple, put the file in a dedicated folder so you won't have all the configs folders everywhere and just run it.

**You need a language file to run the program !!**
To use the language file, simply download the language you want (messages_EN.yaml for example) and the program should automatically ask you for it. Messages files are in the messages folder.

It should do the rest all by itself and you only have to follow the instructions on screen.
Because it is the early versions of the project, sometimes it could not work properly. But if you use it without trying anything weird (having enpty profiles for example) it should work perfectly. (I make it better every time)

The auto updater is out, your program will now update itself in the most recent version.

/!\ If you are under the version 1.0.3, you need to update the config manually to 1.0.4 by changing the version and adding "transfer_detail = False" in the "[Settings]" category./!\

Hope it'll be useful !
I would love feedbacks on anything and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them !

## What is upcoming ?

The first release is coming, in an executable file.

I also have making the UI and UX way better in mind. (but later, i don't have the skills for now.)

Besides that, I don't really know what to add or change in the program, I would like any suggestion !
