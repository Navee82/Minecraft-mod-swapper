# Minecraft-mod-swapper
A simple python project to swap your mods in your .minecraft folder by having different profiles so you don't have to change these mods manually ever again.

For peopole to know : I'm a young french trying to figure out how github works so please forgive my english and my bad project managment.
This is my first python project so the code is probably horrible but hey, it works ! (i might improve it later)
