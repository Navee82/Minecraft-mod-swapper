# Minecraft-mod-swapper
A simple python project to swap your mods in your .minecraft folder by having different profiles so you don't have to change these mods manually ever again.

For peopole to know : I'm a young french trying to figure out how github (and git) works so please forgive my english and my bad project managment.
This is my first python project so the code is probably horrible but hey, it works ! (i might improve it later)


# HOW TO USE THE MOD SWAPPER ?

It is actually very simple, put the file in a dedicated folder so you won't have all the configs folders everywhere and just run it.
It should do it all by itself and you just have to follow the instructions (in french i'm sorry,  I'll translate later)
Because it is the first version of the project, sometimes it won't work but if you use it without trying anything weird (having enpty profiles for example) it should work perfectly

Hope it'll be useful !
