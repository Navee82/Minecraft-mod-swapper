# Minecraft-mod-swapper
A simple python project to swap your mods in your .minecraft folder by having different profiles so you don't have to change these mods manually ever again.

For peopole to know : I'm a young french trying to code something, so please forgive my english and my bad project managment.
This is my first python project, the code is probably horrible but hey, it works ! (i'm constantly improving the code)


## HOW TO USE THE MOD SWAPPER ?

/!\ I messed up, the latest commits might not work, the nexts should be fixed, stay on the version 1.0.5 /!\

Your first need to have python 3.12, tkinker and PyYaml installed.

It is actually very simple, put the file in a dedicated folder so you won't have all the configs folders everywhere and just run it.

**You need a language file to run the program !!**
To use the language file, simply download the language you want (messages_EN.yaml for example) and the program should automatically ask you for it. Messages files are in the messages folder.

It should do the rest all by itself and you only have to follow the instructions on screen.
Because it is the early versions of the project, sometimes it could not work properly. But if you use it without trying anything weird (having enpty profiles for example) it should work perfectly. (I make it better every time)

Hope it'll be useful !
I would love feedbacks on anything and if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them !

## What is upcoming ?

I'm currently working on making a "Help" menu, but i will probably make a full "wiki" on how to use it in **details** (in this file or another idk).
I think of an auto updater, because if you use "old" versions of the mod swapper it might cause issues (mostly for the config) if you update it. I'm trying to make it the most user-friendly possible. The auto-updater should start updating from 1.0.4 or 1.0.5. For each version below, you need to either reset everything or update manually your config.
The first release is also planned asap, with the compiled file to make it easier to use.

I also have making the UI and UX way better in mind. (but later, i don't have the skills for now.)
